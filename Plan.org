* BASE DRINKS
  + Rush
  + Spin Left
  + Spin Right
  + Boom
  + Hop
  + Kick
* NOTE ON SPINS
  Spin Left and Spin Right work the same way, just in reverse. So I'll
  only be adding Spin Left to the below interactions. If both Spin
  Left and Spin Right are in a recipe, they cancel off. If they're the
  only two in the recipe, you get Water.
* OBJECTS
  + Energy Drink
    - Pick up by walking over, and you can drink or mix it later.
    - Other objects can overlap; cannot be picked up if there's a
      block or something blocking it.
    - Explosions destroy it.
  + Block
    - Can be pushed if there's only one in a row
    - Can be kicked
    - Not explosive by default but can be made so with certain recipes
    - Not affected by explosions
  + Cracked Block
    - Like a block, but destroyed on explosions
  + Bomb
    - Like a block but explosive by default
    - Explodes if another explosion hits it, causing a chain reaction
