* BASE DRINKS
  + Rush
  + Left
  + Right
  + Boom
  + Hop
  + Kick
* NOTE ON SPINS
  Left and Right work the same way, just in reverse. So I'll only be
  adding Spin Left to the below interactions. If both Spin Left and
  Spin Right are in a recipe, they cancel off. If they're the only two
  in the recipe, you get Water.
* OBJECTS
  + Energy Drink
    - Pick up by walking over, and you can drink or mix it later.
    - Counts as a solid object and blocks barrels.
    - Cannot be pushed.
    - Explosions destroy it.
  + Wooden Barrel
    - Can be pushed if there's only one in a row
    - Can be kicked
    - Not explosive by default but can be made so with certain recipes
  + Metal Barrel
    - Like a wooden barrel, but immune to explosions
  + Explosive Barrel
    - Like a wooden barrel but explosive by default
    - Explodes if another explosion hits it, causing a chain reaction
  + Pit
    - Kills the player if he falls in
    - Destroys barrels if they fall in
  + Wooden Floor
    - Regular floor, but is destroyed when an explosion hits it
  + Spiked Floor
    - Kills the player on contact
    - Barrels can pass over it seamlessly
  + Balance beam
    - Barrels and the player can slide along it
    - If either the player or a barrel stops on it, it breaks and they
      fall in
  + Pressure plate
    - Can be weighed down by the player or any barrel type
    - Opens or closes doors
  + Arrow panels
    - Obviously :)
    - Will affect both a rushing player and a sliding block
    - Blocks initiate motion if they step on it; player only initiates
      motion if he rushes onto it, not if he casually steps/hops
    - Rush-hopping preserves the hop but changes the direction
  + Wall
    - Impassible
  + Wooden Wall (Sign?)
    - Impassible; can be destroyed by an explosion

* STORY
  + Jerry from Tech Support has won a golden ticket in his favorite
    soda can: Bullseye Cola. He gets invited to the factory that
    manufactures the drink, where the CEO, Maximilian Sterling, gives
    him a virtual tour (Maximilian, himself, appears on various
    television screens in the facility). At the end, Maximilian
    reveals that he is a robotic reconstruction of the real
    Maximilian, who died twenty years ago. The robot has been looking
    for a replacement CEO and offers control over the factory to
    Jerry.
