  + [X] Energy Drink
    - Pick up by walking over, and you can drink or mix it later.
    - Counts as a solid object and blocks barrels.
    - Cannot be pushed.
    - Explosions destroy it.
  + [X] Wooden Barrel
    - Can be pushed if there's only one in a row
    - Can be kicked
    - Not explosive by default but can be made so with certain recipes
  + [X] Metal Barrel
    - Like a wooden barrel, but immune to explosions; can still be
      made explosive itself with a proper kick
  + [X] Explosive Barrel
    - Like a wooden barrel but explosive by default
    - Explodes if another explosion hits it, causing a chain reaction
  + [X] Pit
    - Kills the player if he falls in
    - Destroys barrels if they fall in
  + [X] Wooden Floor

  + [X] Spiked Floor
    - Kills the player on contact
    - Barrels can pass over it seamlessly
  + [ ] Cracked floor
    - Falls, becoming a pit, when something goes over it
    - If the thing stops there, it falls in. If the thing is in
      motion, it doesn't fall in
  + [X] +Pressure plate+
    - Can be weighed down by the player or any barrel type
    - Opens or closes doors
  + [X] Arrow panels
    - Obviously :)
    - Will affect both a rushing player and a sliding block
    - Blocks initiate motion if they step on it; player only initiates
      motion if he rushes onto it, not if he casually steps/hops
    - Rush-hopping preserves the hop but changes the direction
  + [X] Wall
    - Impassible
  + [X] Wooden Wall (Sign?)
