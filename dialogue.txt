push_epi(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "I'm not actually Maxwell Sterling. The real Maxwell Sterling died twenty years ago."));
push_epi(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "His dying wish was to have his personality reconstructed as an AI, so he could keep this place running."));
push_epi(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Unfortunately, the government realized we were being run by a robot, and they didn't like that."));
push_epi(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "So I've been looking for a replacement CEO."));
push_epi(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "I was watching some old movies and had a brilliant idea! I'd give the factory to whoever won a golden ticket!"));
push_epi(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "So what do you say? Do you want to take over Bullseye Cola and this old robot rest?"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Hello, there, prize winner! Welcome to the factory!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "I'm Max Sterling, CEO and president of Bullseye Cola Incorporated."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Congratulations on finding the golden ticket in a can of our soda!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "As your prize, you're entitled to a tour through our facility today!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "I can't make it down there in person, so I'll be guiding you over this intercom."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "If you could, please step on the green star to begin your tour."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Do you want to know the number one thing that puts Bullseye sodas above the competitors?"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "All of our drinks are compatible! Seriously, take your two favorite Bullseye drinks, pour 'em in a glass, and shake it up really good."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Then wait a few hours before drinking. They are still carbonated, and we don't want it to blow up in your face."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Oh, right, this room has a fairly sophisticated security system."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "That door will only open if you solve a tricky puzzle."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "You can never be too careful in this day and age. It's to keep out unsavory types, of course."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "You're going to want to avoid these spike pits in this next room."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "We use them for testing... ... hm..."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Now that I think about it, I'm not entirely certain why we have so many deadly spike pits in this soda factory."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "This next soda is one of my favorites."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "You might say it has a certain... kick to it. Hah!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Eh, that'll be funnier in a minute."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "What? He's in the bomb room? How in blazes did he end up there?"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Uh, listen, Jerry. This one isn't part of the tour. Those are high explosives, so don't touch anything! Just get to the green star as quick as possible!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Why isn't this room under lock and key?!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Sorry I had to disappear for a minute there. I was putting out a fire."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Literally. Our accountant, Ted, is a bit of a pyromaniac. Sometimes things spiral out of control."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "But he's the best darn accountant we've ever had, so we can't get rid of him."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Watch your step in this next room. We use this narrow bridge to keep out intruders!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "And tax collectors. It's a well known scientific fact that tax collectors are afraid of heights."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Sometimes I like to take two or three sodas and mix 'em all together, just for good measure."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "It really brings out those hidden flavors!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "These are arrow panels. If you kick a barrel onto them, it'll go in that direction."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Our lawyers say we have to include at least one arrow panel based puzzle."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "This is Boom Cola! Drink it, and you'll feel so good you'll explode with happiness!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "With emphasis on the \"explode\"!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Did you make it through the metal barrel room?"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Sorry I wasn't there to explain the mechanics. Senator Watson was in town for lunch."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "So I had to go down and, ahem, good-faith charitably donate to her campaign. With no strings attached."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "In totally unrelated news, did you know the Senate is going to vote on some new soda regulations next week? I thought that was interesting."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "I love this next room. It's such a satisfying shot."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "We have our intern put a new barrel here after every tour, just for this trick shot. There's not even anything in the barrel."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Sorry about the mess in this next room."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "We usually have our intern clean out these barrels, but he's out this week."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "He said something about going spelunking in an ancient pyramid. I swear, millennials these days have no dedication to their jobs."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "This is an older portion of the factory, so watch your step."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "That cracked ground will crumble if you step on it."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "This one is called Rush Cola. You won't be able to stop running once you drink it!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "For safety reasons, there must always be a path through each of these rooms, no matter how convoluted it is."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Evacuation plans are available on request. Actually, we just keep them next to Ted's office, since he's responsible for most of the fires in this building anyway."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Best darn accountant in the world!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "This last puzzle is a tricky one."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "If you can make it through here, I've got a surprise for you."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Before I greet you in person, we have to make absolutely sure that you're not a tax collector in disguise."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "I've been informed by HR that I'm not allowed to complain about employees during the tour."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "So please disregard my last comment about our intern."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "As part of your tour, we'd like to invite you to try several of our products."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "This, in particular, is called Hop Cola. When you drink it, you'll jump for joy!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "It says your name here is... Jerry From Tech Support..."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Interesting last name... I suppose you come from a long line of IT professionals."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Well, Mr. Support, welcome once again to our factory! I hope you're enjoying our Hop Cola!"));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "These are our Left and Right Colas. They taste sort of... like a direction, I'm told."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "I have a statement from our legal team here... ahem..."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "\"The names 'Left' and 'Right' Cola should not be construed as endorsement of any political party. Bullseye Cola is and always has been a politically neutral corporation.\""));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "Besides, we don't discriminate. We kick back to all our congressmen equally, regardless of political affiliation."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "I have a memo here from our legal team."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "It says \"kick back\" is not the appropriate term, and they'd prefer I call it a \"good faith charitable donation with no string attached\" in the future."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "So to reiterate, we'll happily make a good faith charitable donation to all political parties, not for any particular incentive, but out of the kindness of our hearts."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.MAX, undefined, "And I'm Max, and I like to hear myself talk!"));

push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.JERRY, undefined, "Yeah... it was a really soggy ticket by the time I found it..."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.JERRY, undefined, "Like tax collectors, I'm sure..."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.JERRY, undefined, "These barrels look a little stronger than the others..."));
push_dia(new Dia(Mugshot.JERRY, undefined, "I bet they're reinforced against explosions."));
